# Nepali Image Captioning

## Overview
Nepali Image Captioning is an innovative project in the field of AI and data science. Its primary objective is to enable image captioning and present the results in both visual and audible formats in the native Nepali language. This project addresses the challenge of inclusivity by catering to the visually impaired and young learners, facilitating their understanding of images through captions.

## Problem Statement
The project recognizes the need for inclusivity in accessing visual content. Visually impaired individuals often face barriers in comprehending images, limiting their ability to engage with visual information. Additionally, young children who are still learning may benefit from image-based learning approaches, which are not always readily available. 

## Solution
The Nepali Image Captioning project offers a solution by providing image captions in the Nepali language. This feature aids visually impaired individuals and young learners in understanding the content of images. By converting visual information into accessible text and audio, the project promotes inclusivity and facilitates learning.

Moreover, the project's applications extend beyond accessibility. It can be utilized in recommendation systems, leveraging data from previous images to recommend new ones. This functionality enhances user experience and expands the project's utility in various domains.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (JS):** Utilized for frontend development, enhancing user interaction and experience.
- **Django:** Employed as the backend framework to manage data and server-side operations.
- **Heroku:** Deployed on the Heroku platform for hosting and deployment.
- **Google Translate API:** Integrated for language translation, enabling the generation of Nepali captions.
- **Keras RNN:** Utilized for training and implementing recurrent neural networks for image captioning.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Applied for text processing and language generation tasks.
- **CSS3 and HTML5:** Used for styling and structuring the frontend components, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
